# chess
This is the final project for the Odin Project's Ruby course

To Run the game, uncomment the last line of 'lib/chess.rb', 'game_menu'
and run that script in the terminal. You will have the opition to load 
a game every time you run it. At the start of each turn, you can elect
to save the game. Whether or not you save it, you will be able to
continue playing.

To run my test suite, ensure that the last line of 'lib/chess.rb', 
'game_menu' is commented and you can rspec the test files in the
spec folder.

Enjoy!
